# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Revert the codebase to Version 54, removing all features and changes introduced in versions 55-59.

**Planned changes:**
- Restore all files to their exact Version 54 state
- Remove StableDialogContent component and restore standard Radix UI DialogContent usage
- Remove mobile keyboard focus handling features from property and inquiry forms
- Delete DRAFT_STATE.md and MOBILE_KEYBOARD_FOCUS_QA_CHECKLIST.md documentation files

**User-visible outcome:** The application functions identically to Version 54, with all subsequent features removed. Dialog forms behave as they did in Version 54 without special mobile keyboard handling.
